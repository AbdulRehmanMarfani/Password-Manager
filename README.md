## Notes

* All data is stored **locally and in plaintext** in `data.json`. For personal use only.
* Email is pre-filled by default but can be changed in `main.py`.
* If `data.json` does not exist, it is automatically created.

---

## Future Improvements

* Add password encryption for better security
* Introduce master password protection
* Add export/import functionality
* Password strength indicator
* Dark mode toggle
